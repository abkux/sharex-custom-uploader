# 📂 ShareX PHP Uploader

A simple PHP script to handle file uploads via ShareX using a secret key for authentication.

## 🚀 Features
- Secure file uploads with a **secret key**.
- Randomized file names to prevent overwriting.
- Configurable file storage directory.
- Simple setup for quick deployment.

---

## 📜 Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Edit Configuration Variables
Modify the following variables in the script:

```php
$secret_key = "your-secret-key"; // Change this to a secure key
$sharexdir = "uploads/"; // Directory for uploaded files (ensure it exists)
$domain_url = 'https://yourdomain.com/'; // Your domain with trailing slash
$lengthofstring = 5; // Length of the generated filename
```

### 2️⃣ Set Up File Permissions
Make sure the upload directory (`$sharexdir`) has the correct permissions:

```sh
chmod -R 777 uploads/
```

### 3️⃣ Configure ShareX
1. Open **ShareX** → Go to **Destinations** → **Custom Uploaders**.
2. Click **New** and configure:
   - **Method**: `POST`
   - **URL**: `https://yourdomain.com/upload.php`
   - **Body**:
     ```json
     {
       "secret": "your-secret-key"
     }
     ```
   - **File Parameter Name**: `sharex`
3. Save and test the uploader.

## ⚠️ Security Considerations
- **Use a strong secret key** to prevent unauthorized uploads.
- **Restrict access** to the upload script if necessary (e.g., using `.htaccess` or IP whitelisting).
- **Enable HTTPS** to secure data transmission.

---

## 🛠 Troubleshooting
If uploads fail, ensure:
- The upload directory exists and has write permissions.
- The correct secret key is provided.
- The server allows file uploads (`post_max_size` and `upload_max_filesize` in `php.ini`).
